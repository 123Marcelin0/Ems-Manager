# UUID Validation Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing UUID validation errors when trying to assign employees to work areas in the "Übersicht" (Overview) view. The error was:

```
Error: Invalid input syntax for type uuid: 'emp-001'
```

## Root Cause
The system was attempting to assign **example employees** (with IDs like 'emp-001', 'emp-002', etc.) to work areas in the database. However, the database expects real UUID format employee IDs, not the string-based example employee IDs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Work Assignments Hook Validation**
- Added validation in `assignEmployee()` function to check if employee ID starts with 'emp-'
- Added validation in `removeAssignment()` function to prevent example employee operations
- Both functions now throw descriptive errors for example employees

### 2. **Work Area Overview Component Protection**
- Added checks in all assignment functions to skip example employees
- Updated drag and drop handlers to prevent example employee assignments
- Added filtering to only show real employees for work area assignments

### 3. **User-Friendly Error Handling**
- Added empty state message when no real employees are available
- Added console warnings instead of throwing errors for better UX
- Graceful handling of example vs. real employee scenarios

### 4. **Database Operation Safety**
- All database operations now validate employee IDs before execution
- Example employees are handled locally without database calls
- Real employees go through proper database validation

## Key Changes Made

### `hooks/use-work-assignments.ts`
```typescript
// Added validation before database operations
if (employeeId.startsWith('emp-')) {
  console.log('⚠️ Cannot assign example employee to work area - database operation skipped')
  throw new Error('Cannot assign example employees to work areas. Please use real employees from the database.')
}
```

### `components/work-area/work-area-overview/index.tsx`
```typescript
// Filter out example employees for work area assignments
const selectedEmployeesForEvent = transformedEmployees.filter(emp => {
  return !emp.id.startsWith('emp-') // Filter out example employees
})

// Added validation in assignment functions
if (employee.id.startsWith('emp-')) {
  console.warn('Cannot assign example employee to work area')
  return
}
```

## Result
- ✅ No more UUID validation errors
- ✅ Example employees can still be used for status changes and random selection
- ✅ Work area assignments only work with real database employees
- ✅ Clear user feedback when no real employees are available
- ✅ Graceful degradation between example and real employee scenarios

## How It Works Now

### For Example Employees
- Can be used for status changes (available, selected, etc.)
- Can be used for random selection functionality
- **Cannot** be assigned to work areas (shows warning)
- All operations remain local to the UI

### For Real Database Employees
- Full functionality including work area assignments
- Status changes are persisted to database
- Can be assigned to work areas with proper UUID validation
- All database operations work normally

## Testing
- Application builds successfully without errors
- Work area overview loads without UUID errors
- Example employees are properly filtered out
- Real employees can be assigned to work areas normally
- User-friendly messages appear when appropriate
