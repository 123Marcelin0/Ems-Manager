# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive audit and improvement of the entire data persistence layer in the Employee Management System. The goal is to ensure that every piece of data - settings, work areas, events, employee statuses - saves and loads correctly without any errors, providing a completely reliable single-user application experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Database Route Audit

**User Story:** As the sole user of the application, I want all database routes to be thoroughly audited and tested, so that every data operation works flawlessly without any persistence errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data is saved THEN the system SHALL persist it correctly to the database without data loss
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve all saved data accurately and completely
3. WHEN switching between events THEN the system SHALL load the correct event-specific data without mixing or losing information
4. WHEN any CRUD operation is performed THEN the system SHALL handle it reliably with proper error handling
5. IF any database route fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Event-Specific Data Isolation and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple events, I want each event to maintain its own separate data state, so that employee statuses, work areas, and settings are always event-specific and never mixed between events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an event THEN the system SHALL load only that event's specific employee statuses
2. WHEN employee status changes for one event THEN the system SHALL NOT affect their status in other events
3. WHEN work areas are configured for an event THEN the system SHALL save and load them correctly for that specific event only
4. WHEN switching between events THEN the system SHALL completely refresh all event-dependent data
5. IF event data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and repair inconsistencies automatically

### Requirement 3: Work Area Configuration Reliability

**User Story:** As a user configuring work areas, I want all work area settings to save and load perfectly, so that capacity, roles, and assignments are always preserved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN work areas are created or modified THEN the system SHALL save all configuration data immediately
2. WHEN loading an event THEN the system SHALL restore all work area configurations exactly as saved
3. WHEN employee assignments are made THEN the system SHALL persist the assignments reliably
4. WHEN work area capacity is changed THEN the system SHALL update and save the new limits correctly
5. IF work area data is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL validate and correct it automatically

### Requirement 4: Employee Status Persistence Across All Events

**User Story:** As a user managing employee availability, I want employee statuses to be saved and loaded correctly for every event, so that I never lose track of who is available, working, or unavailable for specific events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN employee status is updated THEN the system SHALL save the change immediately to the database
2. WHEN loading employee data for an event THEN the system SHALL show the correct status for each employee
3. WHEN employees transition between statuses THEN the system SHALL track and persist all status changes
4. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL restore all employee statuses exactly as they were
5. IF status data becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL detect conflicts and resolve them automatically

### Requirement 5: Settings and Configuration Persistence

**User Story:** As a user customizing application settings, I want all configuration changes to be saved permanently, so that my preferences and settings are always preserved between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any setting is changed THEN the system SHALL save it immediately to persistent storage
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore all settings to their last saved state
3. WHEN configuration is exported or imported THEN the system SHALL handle the data transfer without corruption
4. WHEN settings are reset THEN the system SHALL restore proper default values
5. IF settings become corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and restore from backup or defaults

### Requirement 6: Real-time Data Synchronization Reliability

**User Story:** As a user working with live data, I want all changes to be synchronized immediately and reliably, so that the UI always reflects the current database state without delays or inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes in the database THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately
2. WHEN multiple components display the same data THEN the system SHALL keep them all synchronized
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync any pending changes automatically
4. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully
5. IF synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and notify the user of any issues

### Requirement 7: Data Validation and Integrity Enforcement

**User Story:** As a user entering data, I want the system to validate and protect data integrity, so that invalid or corrupted data never gets saved to the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate it completely before saving
2. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show clear error messages
3. WHEN data relationships exist THEN the system SHALL enforce referential integrity automatically
4. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL verify its integrity and consistency
5. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic repair or alert the user

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user experiencing system issues, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery, so that I can always recover from problems without losing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them comprehensively and attempt recovery
2. WHEN network issues interrupt operations THEN the system SHALL queue changes and retry automatically
3. WHEN data conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL resolve them intelligently or prompt for user decision
4. WHEN system crashes occur THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully without data loss
5. IF recovery fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual recovery tools and clear instructions

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability Optimization

**User Story:** As a user working with large amounts of data, I want the system to perform efficiently, so that data operations are fast and responsive regardless of data volume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large datasets THEN the system SHALL use efficient queries and caching
2. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without blocking the UI
3. WHEN data grows over time THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance
4. WHEN complex queries are needed THEN the system SHALL optimize them for speed
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and suggest optimizations

### Requirement 10: Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive testing and monitoring of all data operations, so that I can ensure the system remains reliable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive automated tests for all data operations
2. WHEN data operations are performed THEN the system SHALL monitor their success and performance
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide diagnostic information
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN the system SHALL report on data integrity and consistency
5. IF problems are found THEN the system SHALL provide tools for diagnosis and repair
