# Work Area Persistence Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The work area management system currently has two critical issues:
1. **Infinite Loop Error**: When trying to turn off an event card, the system enters an infinite loop causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
2. **Data Persistence Failure**: Saved work areas disappear when switching pages and only reappear when manually re-selecting the same event through the event chooser

These issues stem from conflicting requirements between preventing infinite re-renders and maintaining proper data loading/persistence across page navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Prevent Infinite Loop Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to turn off event cards without encountering system errors, so that I can manage events smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks to turn off an event card THEN the system SHALL NOT enter an infinite loop
2. WHEN location changes are triggered THEN the system SHALL prevent circular dependency updates
3. WHEN event context updates occur THEN the system SHALL avoid recursive state updates
4. WHEN useEffect hooks run THEN they SHALL have properly managed dependencies to prevent infinite re-renders

### Requirement 2: Maintain Work Area Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my saved work area configurations to persist when I navigate between pages, so that I don't lose my setup work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN work areas are saved for an event THEN they SHALL remain available after page navigation
2. WHEN a user switches to a different page and returns THEN the work areas SHALL load automatically
3. WHEN an event is selected THEN its associated work areas SHALL load without requiring manual re-selection
4. WHEN the component mounts THEN it SHALL properly fetch and display saved work areas for the current event

### Requirement 3: Reliable Event Context Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the selected event to remain consistent across all components, so that my work context is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is selected THEN it SHALL remain selected across page navigation
2. WHEN event data changes in the database THEN the context SHALL update without causing infinite loops
3. WHEN multiple components use the event context THEN they SHALL receive consistent data
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL restore the previously selected event from persistence

### Requirement 4: Robust Component Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to handle mounting/unmounting gracefully, so that state updates don't occur on unmounted components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component unmounts THEN it SHALL cancel any pending async operations
2. WHEN state updates are triggered THEN they SHALL only occur if the component is still mounted
3. WHEN useEffect cleanup functions run THEN they SHALL properly prevent memory leaks
4. WHEN async operations complete THEN they SHALL check component mount status before updating state

### Requirement 5: Optimized Data Loading Strategy

**User Story:** As a user, I want work area data to load efficiently without unnecessary re-fetching, so that the interface responds quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN work areas are already loaded THEN the system SHALL NOT refetch them unnecessarily
2. WHEN an event changes THEN only the relevant data SHALL be reloaded
3. WHEN database operations complete THEN the UI SHALL update with the latest data
4. WHEN loading states occur THEN they SHALL be properly managed to prevent race conditions
