# 🎯 Work Areas Database Integration - COMPLETE GUIDE

## ✅ **What's Been Fixed:**

### 1. **Database Integration**
- ✅ Created `useWorkAreas` hook for database operations
- ✅ Connected Arbeitsbereiche section to save work areas to database
- ✅ Connected Übersicht view to load real work areas from database
- ✅ Work areas are now linked to specific events via `event_id`

### 2. **Component Updates**
- ✅ `WorkAreaManagement` now saves to database instead of mock data
- ✅ `WorkAreaOverview` loads real work areas for selected event
- ✅ Employee assignments work with actual work area configurations

## 🔧 **How It Works Now:**

### **Step 1: Event Selection**
1. **Go to:** Work Planner → Event (select an event)
2. **Your event is now selected** and ready for work area configuration

### **Step 2: Arbeitsbereiche (Work Areas Configuration)**
1. **Click:** "Arbeitsbereiche" tab
2. **Create work areas:**
   - Name: e.g., "Main Entrance"
   - Location: Choose from dropdown
   - Max Capacity: Set number of employees
   - Role Requirements: Set how many of each role (Manager, Allrounder, etc.)
3. **Click:** "Save" → "Normal speichern"
4. **✅ Result:** Work areas are **saved to database** linked to your event

### **Step 3: Übersicht (Employee Assignment)**
1. **Click:** "Übersicht" tab
2. **See:** Only the work areas you created for this specific event
3. **Assign employees:**
   - Drag employees from left panel to work area cards
   - Or use auto-assignment buttons
4. **Save assignments** to database

## 🚀 **Database Operations:**

### **Work Areas API Endpoints:**
```typescript
// Get work areas for specific event
GET /api/work-areas?eventId={eventId}

// Create new work area
POST /api/work-areas
{
  event_id: "uuid",
  name: "Main Entrance", 
  location: "emslandarena",
  max_capacity: 4,
  role_requirements: { "manager": 1, "allrounder": 2 },
  is_active: true
}

// Update work area
PUT /api/work-areas/{id}

// Delete work area  
DELETE /api/work-areas/{id}
```

### **Database Tables:**
```sql
-- Work areas are stored here, linked to events
work_areas (
  id UUID,
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  name VARCHAR(255),
  location VARCHAR(255), 
  max_capacity INTEGER,
  role_requirements JSONB,
  is_active BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)

-- Employee assignments are stored here
work_assignments (
  id UUID,
  employee_id UUID REFERENCES employees(id),
  work_area_id UUID REFERENCES work_areas(id), 
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

## 🎯 **Testing the Complete Workflow:**

### **Test Scenario 1: Create Work Areas**
1. **Select event:** "My Real Event" 
2. **Go to Arbeitsbereiche:**
   - Create "Main Entrance" (4 capacity, 1 manager + 2 allrounder)
   - Create "Food Court" (6 capacity, 3 verkauf + 2 essen + 1 allrounder)
3. **Save:** Click "Save" → "Normal speichern"
4. **Verify:** Check database or refresh page - work areas persist

### **Test Scenario 2: Employee Assignment**
1. **Go to Übersicht**
2. **See:** Only your created work areas (not mock data!)
3. **Assign:** Drag employees to appropriate work areas
4. **Verify:** Employees appear in work area cards

### **Test Scenario 3: Event-Specific Configuration**
1. **Switch to different event**
2. **Go to Übersicht**  
3. **See:** Empty or different work areas (event-specific!)
4. **Create work areas for this event**
5. **Verify:** Each event has its own work area configuration

## 🔍 **Key Features Working:**

### **Event-Specific Work Areas**
- ✅ Each event has its own work area configuration
- ✅ Switching events shows different work areas
- ✅ No more shared mock data between events

### **Database Persistence** 
- ✅ Work areas save to Supabase `work_areas` table
- ✅ Linked to specific events via `event_id`
- ✅ Role requirements stored as JSON

### **Real-Time Updates**
- ✅ Work areas update in real-time across components
- ✅ Changes persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Multiple users see same configuration

### **Employee Assignment**
- ✅ Employees can be assigned to work areas
- ✅ Assignments respect role requirements
- ✅ Drag & drop functionality works
- ✅ Auto-assignment based on roles

## 🛠️ **Advanced Configuration:**

### **Role Requirements Format:**
```json
{
  "manager": 1,
  "allrounder": 2, 
  "versorger": 1,
  "verkauf": 0,
  "essen": 0
}
```

### **Location Options:**
- `emslandarena` - Emslandarena

### **Work Area States:**
- `is_active: true` - Work area is active and available
- `is_active: false` - Work area is disabled
