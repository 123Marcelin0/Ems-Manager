# Supabase Backend Setup Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ

Your Supabase project is configured and ready! Here's what we've accomplished:

### 1. Environment Configuration ‚úÖ
- `.env.local` file created with your Supabase credentials
- Supabase client configured in `lib/supabase.ts`
- Connection tested successfully

### 2. Database Schema Ready üìã
Created 4 migration files in `supabase/migrations/`:
- `001_initial_schema.sql` - Core database tables and relationships
- `002_rls_policies.sql` - Row Level Security policies
- `003_fair_distribution_algorithm.sql` - Fair employee selection algorithm
- `004_sample_data.sql` - Sample data for testing

### 3. React Hooks Created ‚öõÔ∏è
- `hooks/use-employees.ts` - Employee management with real-time updates
- `hooks/use-events.ts` - Event management with recruitment tracking

## Next Steps - Database Setup

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

You need to run the SQL migrations in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vnxhfmrjzwxumaakgwmq
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. **Run each migration file in order**:

#### Migration 1: Initial Schema
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` and run it.

#### Migration 2: RLS Policies  
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql` and run it.

#### Migration 3: Fair Distribution Algorithm
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/003_fair_distribution_algorithm.sql` and run it.

#### Migration 4: Sample Data
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/004_sample_data.sql` and run it.

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

After running migrations, verify in Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Check Tables** (Database ‚Üí Tables):
   - employees
   - events  
   - work_areas
   - employee_event_status
   - work_assignments
   - time_records
   - whatsapp_messages
   - audit_logs

2. **Check Sample Data**:
   - Should see 10 sample employees
   - Should see 3 sample events
   - Should see work areas for Summer Festival

### Step 3: Test Frontend Integration

Once database is set up, test the React hooks:

```typescript
// In any component
import { useEmployees } from '@/hooks/use-employees'
import { useEvents } from '@/hooks/use-events'

function TestComponent() {
  const { employees, loading: employeesLoading } = useEmployees()
  const { events, loading: eventsLoading } = useEvents()
  
  if (employeesLoading || eventsLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Employees: {employees.length}</h2>
      <h2>Events: {events.length}</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables

1. **employees** - Employee profiles with work history
2. **events** - Event definitions with status lifecycle  
3. **work_areas** - Event-specific work locations
4. **employee_event_status** - Per-event employee availability
5. **time_records** - Work session tracking
6. **whatsapp_messages** - Message history
7. **audit_logs** - Complete system activity

### Key Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Fair Distribution Algorithm** - Prioritizes employees who haven't worked recently
‚úÖ **Work History Tracking** - Automatic updates of last_worked_date and total_hours
‚úÖ **Event Lifecycle Management** - Status transitions from draft to completed
‚úÖ **Real-time Updates** - Live synchronization across clients
‚úÖ **Row Level Security** - Proper access control and data isolation
‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Complete activity logging
‚úÖ **WhatsApp Integration Ready** - Tables and structure for Twilio integration

## What's Next

After database setup, you can:

1. **Replace mock data** in your React components with real Supabase data
2. **Implement WhatsApp integration** using the prepared database structure
3. **Add authentication** for managers vs employees
4. **Build the fair distribution UI** using the selection algorithm
5. **Add real-time features** using the prepared hooks

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify `.env.local` has correct Supabase URL and key
- Check Supabase project is active and not paused

### Migration Errors
- Run migrations one at a time in the SQL Editor
- Check for syntax errors in the SQL
- Verify you have proper permissions

### RLS Policy Issues
- Ensure you're authenticated when testing
- Check policy functions are created correctly
- Verify user roles are set up properly

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase Dashboard logs
2. Verify environment variables are loaded
3. Test connection with the provided test script
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages
