# Employee Table Examples Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the "Mitarbeiter und Events" page with comprehensive example data to provide a better user experience when no real database data is available.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Employee Examples

**Added 5 comprehensive example employees** with German names and realistic data:

- **Anna Schmidt** - 45 hours, €697.50 total payment
- **Thomas Müller** - 38 hours, €608.00 total payment  
- **Sarah Klein** - 52 hours, €936.00 total payment
- **Michael Weber** - 41 hours, €656.00 total payment
- **Lisa Wagner** - 35 hours, €525.00 total payment

Each employee includes:
- Realistic work hours and payment calculations
- German names and locations
- Detailed event history with specific times and locations
- Different hourly rates (€15.00 - €18.00)

### 2. Enhanced Event Examples

**Added 3 additional events** to the existing mock data:

- **Wintermarkt 2025** - 10 employees, 80 hours, €1,200.00
- **Hochzeitsmesse** - 6 employees, 48 hours, €768.00  
- **Firmenjubiläum** - 18 employees, 144 hours, €2,304.00

### 3. Improved Data Logic

**Updated the employee display logic**:
- Shows real database employees when available
- Falls back to example employees when no real data exists
- Removed empty state that showed "no employees available"
- Ensures users always see meaningful data for demonstration

### 4. German Localization

**All example data uses German**:
- German employee names (Anna Schmidt, Thomas Müller, etc.)
- German event names (Neujahrsfeier, Wintermarkt, Konzert, etc.)
- German locations (Emslandarena, Stadtplatz, Hotel Residenz, etc.)
- Consistent with the application's German interface

## Technical Implementation

### Example Employee Structure
```typescript
const exampleEmployees: EmployeeWorkRecord[] = [
  {
    id: "example-1",
    employeeName: "Anna Schmidt",
    period: "Januar 2025",
    totalHours: 45,
    totalPayment: 697.50,
    hourlyRate: 15.50,
    events: [
      {
        id: "E1",
        eventName: "Neujahrsfeier",
        date: "2025-01-01",
        hoursWorked: 8,
        hourlyRate: 15.50,
        location: "Emslandarena",
        startTime: "18:00",
        endTime: "02:00"
      }
      // ... more events
    ]
  }
  // ... more employees
]
```

### Smart Data Display Logic
```typescript
const filteredEmployees = availableEmployees.length > 0 
  ? availableEmployees.map(emp => ({
      // Transform real database employees
    }))
  : exampleEmployees // Show examples when no real data
```
