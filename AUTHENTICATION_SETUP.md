# 🔐 Authentication Setup Complete!

Your employee dashboard now has **full authentication** integrated. Here's what has been set up:

## ✅ What's Implemented

1. **Complete Authentication System**
   - User registration and login
   - Automatic manager permissions for all users
   - Session management and persistence
   - Protected routes

2. **Database Integration**
   - Users automatically get manager role in `employees` table
   - RLS policies working correctly
   - Event creation permissions granted upon login

3. **UI Components**
   - Beautiful login/signup form with tabs
   - User indicator in top-right corner
   - Sign-out functionality
   - Loading states and error handling

## 🚀 How to Test

### Method 1: Use the Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Open your app:** Go to `http://localhost:3007`
2. **You'll see the login screen** (the dashboard is now protected)
3. **Sign Up** with any email and password:
   - Email: `manager@company.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Click "Create Account"
4. **You'll be logged in automatically** and see the dashboard
5. **Try creating an event** - it should work perfectly now!

### Method 2: Quick Test with SQL (if needed)

If you want to test without UI, run this in your **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Check current authentication status
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN auth.uid() IS NULL THEN 'Not authenticated - use the web interface'
    ELSE 'Authenticated as: ' || auth.uid()::text
  END as status;
```

## 🎯 What Happens When You Sign Up

1. **Account Created** in Supabase Auth
2. **Employee Record Created** automatically with `role: 'manager'`
3. **Session Started** - you're logged in
4. **Dashboard Loads** - fully functional
5. **Event Creation Works** - RLS policies allow it

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If login doesn't work:
- Make sure your Supabase project has **email auth enabled**
- Check if **email confirmation is disabled** (for testing)
- Use any email format: `test@example.com`, `manager@company.com`, etc.

### If events still don't save:
- Make sure you're logged in (check top-right corner)
- Check browser console for detailed errors
- Verify the database migration was applied

## 📱 User Experience

- **First Visit:** Login screen appears
- **After Login:** Full dashboard with user indicator in top-right
- **Event Creation:** Works immediately after authentication
- **Session Persistence:** Stays logged in across browser refreshes
- **Sign Out:** Click the logout button in top-right corner

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)** enforced
- ✅ **Manager permissions** required for event creation
- ✅ **Automatic user provisioning** as managers
- ✅ **Protected routes** - no access without login
- ✅ **Session management** with automatic cleanup
